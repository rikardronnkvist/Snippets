# MSRC - Microsoft Security Response Center

Two scripts, the first [Get-MSRCUpdates.ps1](./Get-MSRCUpdates.ps1) creates an object that you can use in other scripts. The second script [MSRSC-Update-ToTeams.ps1](./MSRSC-Update-ToTeams.ps1) uses that objects with the help of [PSTeams](http://github.com/evotecit/psteams/) to post the information in MS Teams via a WebHook.
